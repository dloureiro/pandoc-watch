## How to use `pandoc-watch`

`pandoc-watch` mainly adds an extra argument to the `pandoc` standard options : `-e,--exclude` used to exclude:

 * file extensions
 * folders 
 
from the monitoring when watching for file or folder changes.

Aside from this option, the reminder is passed to the `pandoc` executable without modification.

### Default exclusions

If no exclusion option is provided the default value is `.pdf,.tex,doc,bin,common`. This default values fit my needs and can be modified if necessary.

### Excluding file extensions from the monitoring

To add file extensions to the excluded extensions, call `pandoc-watch` as follow:

    pandoc-watch -e ".pdf,.tex" ...

This commande will exclude all files with `pdf` or `tex` extensions from the monitoring.

### Excluding folders from the monitoring

To exclude folders from the monitoring, call `pandoc-watch` as follow:

    pandoc-watch -e "bin,common"
